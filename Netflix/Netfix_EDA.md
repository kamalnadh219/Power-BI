# Data Cleaning with Power Query in Power BI

This repository contains the process and steps involved in cleaning a dataset using Power Query in Power BI. The objective is to demonstrate how data can be transformed and prepared for analysis in a clear and structured manner.

## Overview

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis process. It involves identifying and rectifying errors and inconsistencies in the data to ensure high-quality results. This repository showcases the data cleaning techniques applied to a sample dataset using Power Query in Power BI.

## Steps Involved

1. **Importing Data**
   - Data was imported from various sources such as Excel, CSV, and SQL databases into Power BI using Power Query.

2. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure each entry is unique.

3. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Missing values were managed by either removing rows with missing data or imputing values based on the context.

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Columns were split and merged to achieve the desired structure.
   - Data types were adjusted to ensure consistency and accuracy.

5. **Filtering and Sorting**
   - Irrelevant data was filtered out, and the dataset was sorted based on specific criteria to aid in further analysis.

6. **Normalization**
   - Data normalization techniques were applied to ensure that the data follows a consistent scale and format.

7. **Creating Custom Columns**
   - New columns were created using custom formulas to enhance the dataset and derive additional insights.

8. **Renaming Columns and Rows**
   - Columns and rows were renamed to provide clear and meaningful identifiers.
